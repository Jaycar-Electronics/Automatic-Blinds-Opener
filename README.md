# Automatic Blinds Opener
Let the power of the sun encourage you to get out of bed each morning with this curtain/blinds opener. Weâ€™ve made a little motor/solar panel combo that will automatically open your blinds at sunrise and close at sunset. We've also included a remote so you can open and shut them whenever you want.
