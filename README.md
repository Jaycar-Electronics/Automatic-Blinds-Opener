# Automatic Blinds Opener
Let the power of the sun encourage you to get out of bed each morning with this curtain/blinds opener. Weâ€™ve made a little motor/solar panel combo that will automatically open your blinds at sunrise and close at sunset. We've also included a remote so you can open and shut them whenever you want.

## Assembly

This project is a lot more free-form than other projects, as you've got to set it up to connect to your own home blinds.

#### Stepper motor controller.
The stepper motor controller could probably be the only difficult part of this, as you've got to get the windings in the right order. Thankfully we've found an easy way to convey the information

looking directly at your stepper motor, you can see the 4 wires going left to right, what you want to do is connect them to A and B ( + and - ) for both, with the outside ones connecting directly and the inside ones crossed over.
